# 14-Week Seminar Plan

This plan complements a course with 1-hour lectures and 2-hour tutorials, focusing seminars on application, discussion, and synthesis.

---

## Roles of Course Components

* **Lecture (1h)**: Introduce concepts, provide theory, walkthrough examples.
* **Tutorial / Lab (2h)**: Structured practice with guided exercises; students code along and solve tasks.
* **Seminar (2h)**: Apply knowledge, problem-solving, discussion, mini-projects, code review, and teamwork.

---

## Ideas for Seminar Activities

1. **Problem-solving sessions**: Open-ended tasks that require designing algorithms or solutions.
2. **Code reviews**: Students exchange solutions from tutorials and review each other’s code.
3. **Mini-projects / case studies**: Short team tasks that combine multiple topics.
4. **Algorithm/logic discussions**: Compare approaches, debate recursion vs iteration, or different data structures.
5. **Debugging workshops**: Provide buggy code and have students find/fix errors collaboratively.
6. **Presentation & explanation practice**: Students explain their algorithm/design decisions to peers.
7. **Assessment preparation**: Mock tests, oral questions, or solving past exam tasks under guidance.

## Week-by-Week Seminar Plan (2h each)

### Week 1 – Introduction & Course Orientation

* Activity: Icebreaker, discuss course expectations, form project groups.
* Mini activity: Analyze a simple algorithm and trace it manually.
* Goal: Set seminar tone; practice reading code.

### Week 2 – Basic Programming Concepts

* Activity: Small exercises in groups (loops, conditionals).
* Discuss multiple ways to solve same problem; introduce code review practice.

### Week 3 – Functions / Methods

* Students take a short function from tutorials, explain it to peers.
* Seminar task: Modify or extend a function collaboratively.

### Week 4 – Arrays / Collections

* Problem-solving: Find patterns, sums, or maxima in arrays.
* Introduce mini “algorithm discussion”: compare iterative vs recursive approaches.

### Week 5 – Strings & Text Processing

* Debugging workshop: provide buggy string-manipulation code.
* Students fix and optimize it in pairs.

### Week 6 – Recursion

* Dry-run exercises on whiteboard.
* Discuss recursion vs iteration trade-offs.

### Week 7 – Mid-course Mini-project Kickoff

* Introduce 2–3 week mini-project (e.g., text-based game or small calculator).
* Groups start planning structure and algorithms.

### Week 8 – Loops & Algorithm Design

* Problem-solving challenges from previous tutorials.
* Groups refine project algorithms; peer feedback.

### Week 9 – Data Structures (Lists, Stacks, Queues)

* Small case-study exercises (e.g., implement stack operations).
* Compare approaches in groups.

### Week 10 – Sorting & Searching

* Debug and analyze different sorting algorithms.
* Seminar challenge: optimize a simple search/sort problem collaboratively.

### Week 11 – File I/O & Persistence

* Task: Read/write small datasets, e.g., high-score tables for mini-project.
* Discuss best practices for handling input/output errors.

### Week 12 – Mini-project Presentations (Draft)

* Each group presents project progress.
* Peer and teacher feedback on logic, structure, and readability.

### Week 13 – Advanced Topics / Problem-solving Marathon

* Open-ended exercises combining multiple topics (arrays, loops, functions).
* Groups debug and optimize code collaboratively.

### Week 14 – Mini-project Final Presentations & Reflection

* Final group presentations.
* Reflect on lessons learned, code quality, teamwork, and problem-solving approaches.
